BDF2TXT and TXT2BDF
------------------------------------------------------------------------
This two little tools are useful for translating bdf fonts to a textual
representation, which can be edited with any text editor, and back.
Take a look at chess.bdf and chess.txt for an example...

There is nearly no error checking, especially the BBX statements must be
`handcoded' when changing the size of a glyph.

Have fun ;-)
